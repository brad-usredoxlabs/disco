    label: Palmidrol
    source: ontology
    definition: A natural fatty acid amide that is both a food component and an
      endogenously synthesized compound, with potential analgesic and
      anti-inflammatory activities. Upon administration, palmidrol may inhibit
      the release of pro-inflammatory mediators from activated mast cells. This
      may reduce inflammation and pain.

    label: Ethanol-containing Nasal Solution
    source: ontology
    definition: An intranasal solution containing ethanol with antimicrobial
      activity. Upon intranasal application, ethanol-containing nasal solution
      may prevent colonization of the nasal cavity. The antimicrobial effect of
      ethanol is due, in part, to its denaturing of microbial proteins.
